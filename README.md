### Project Title: 
Sentiment Analysis of code-mixed Telugu-English text using Sequence Models

### Objective:
To develop a deep learning model for sentiment analysis of code-mixed data, where multiple languages are used in a single text.

### Data:
The project will use a publicly available Telugu-English code-mixed dataset, which will be preprocessed and cleaned. The data will be annotated with sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral).

### Methodology:
A deep learning model such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) will be trained on the annotated data to identify the sentiment of the code-mixed text. The model will be evaluated based on its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Tools & Techniques: 
The project will be implemented using Python programming language and deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow. The model will be trained using a GPU for faster computation.

### Significance: 
Sentiment analysis of code-mixed data is a challenging task due to the complexity of multiple languages in a single text. The deep learning model developed in this project will be useful for various real-world applications such as customer feedback analysis, social media analysis, and brand monitoring.

### Deliverables:
The project will deliver a trained deep learning model, a report on the experiment results, and the code used for training the model.
